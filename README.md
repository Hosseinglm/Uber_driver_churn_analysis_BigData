Driver churn analysis based on Uber dataset using big data tools such as Hive, PySpark, Pig, BigQuery, Hbase, and MongoDB.

Since the ecosystem of the ride-hailing sector is primarily dependent on “Drivers”, who are independent contractors who provide vehicles and services

a competitor company or in another sector. By analysing the dataset, we would be able to identify these drivers and investigate their income to determine
how many of these resignations have happened because of income matters.
